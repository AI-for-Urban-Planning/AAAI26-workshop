<!-- Urban planning faces increasingly complex challenges due to rapid urbanization, population growth, and the imperative to create sustainable, resilient cities. Traditional urban planning approaches often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of urban environments, leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation, transportation systems, and infrastructure development. Moreover, the advent of new technologies and data sources has generated vast amounts of urban data, presenting both opportunities and challenges in harnessing this data to inform decision-making processes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to revolutionize urban planning by enabling data-driven insights, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques to address these challenges effectively. Leveraging AI techniques such as machine learning, multimodal learning, generative modeling, optimization, and reinforcement learning can enhance the understanding of complex urban systems, optimize resource allocation, and facilitate evidence-based policy-making. Organizing a workshop on “AI for Urban Planning” in conjunction with AAAI 2025 is not only timely but imperative, as it provides a premier platform to convene top researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in the field of AI. This workshop will serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary discussions, showcase cutting-edge research, and foster collaborations to advance the state-of-the-art in AI for Urban Planning. By harnessing the collective expertise of the AAAI community, we can accelerate the development and adoption of innovative solutions to address pressing urban challenges, ultimately creating more sustainable, equitable, and resilient cities for the future. -->

Urban planning faces increasingly complex challenges due to rapid urbanization, population growth, and the imperative to create sustainable, resilient cities. Traditional planning approaches often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic, human-centric nature of urban systems, resulting in inefficiencies in resource allocation, transportation, and infrastructure development. The rise of new technologies and diverse data sources has produced vast, multimodal urban datasets—offering opportunities for deeper insight, but also raising challenges related to data quality, ethical considerations, and the interpretability of AI models. AI holds immense promise for advancing urban planning by enabling data-driven insights, predictive modeling, and optimization, while emerging techniques like explainable AI and knowledge-based methods help align AI tools with the interpretive and societal goals of urban science. Together, AI and urban science can foster a co-learning paradigm—what may be termed the “New Urban Science”—to build smarter, more equitable, and sustainable cities.
Leveraging AI techniques such as machine learning, multimodal learning, generative modeling, optimization, and reinforcement learning can enhance the understanding of complex urban systems, optimize resource allocation, and facilitate evidence-based policy-making. Organizing a workshop on “AI for Urban Planning” in conjunction with AAAI 2026 is not only timely but imperative, as it provides a premier platform to convene top researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in the field of AI.
This workshop will serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary discussions, showcase cutting-edge research, and foster collaborations to advance the state-of-the-art in AI for Urban Planning. Building on the momentum of the successful ”1st Workshop on AI for Urban Planning” at AAAI 2025, this workshop aims to continue to harness the collective expertise of the AAAI community, accelerating the development and adoption of innovative solutions for pressing urban challenges, and ultimately fostering more sustainable, equitable, and resilient cities.
